## Chat-PDF

The project is a Streamlit web application that allows users to interact with the contents of PDF documents using a conversational AI model. Users can upload PDFs, which are processed to enable querying their contents in a conversational manner. Utilized the GeminiAI API to process user inquiries and deliver accurate responses from the PDF content. Achieved a significant reduction in response time for user inquiries by integrating the application with GeminiAI API.
